## Setting Up and Running the Project

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Initial Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   npm i
   ```

2. **Configure API Key**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file in the format:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=YourAPIKeyHere
     ```

3. **Decomment the Vectra Line**:
   Open the `index.js` file and locate the following line:
   ```javascript
   //populateVectra(index);
   ```
   Uncomment this line by removing the `//` at the start.

### Running the Vectra Project

   - Host: `localhost`
   
   If you have a different setup or want to create a new PostgreSQL user and database, update the connection details in the provided Sequelize configuration.
